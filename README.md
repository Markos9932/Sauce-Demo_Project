# ATTENTION

This is a living, WIP document, which has the ultimate aim to serve as a comprehensive guide for developers, QA engineers and other interested parties
to run, maintain and optimize Cypress E2E tests for the Swag Labs application.

## Automated tests

The folder contains automated frontend tests which are implemented using the [Cypress] framework.


## Running tests

In order to run the tests, first install the dependencies: 

```bash
npm install
```

Then, in order to run all tests in console, issue:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

If you want to run tests on UI, issue:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

If you want to run all tests, issue:

```bash
npm test
```

If you want to run tests in headless, issue:

```bash
npm run test:headless
```

If you want to run specific test suite, issue:

```bash
npm run test:specific  (in order to run specific test suite, you can add path to file in a test script in a package.json)
```
